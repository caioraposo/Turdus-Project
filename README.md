### Overview
---

... working in progress ... :soon:

The genus *Turdus* (Aves, Turdidae) consists of 75 currently recognized species occurring throughout the world. Previous attempts to reconstruct phylogenies have proved extremely challenging due to short internal branches and low node support. South and Central America currently host the highest number of species (23 of 75) in the genus Turdus (Aves: Turdidae), and previous studies ([Nylander et al, 2008](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/2/257.full.pdf+html)) suggest that this is due to an exceptional radiation following dispersal from Africa (see below, Figure 1, from [Nylander et al, 2008](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/2/257.full.pdf+html)).

The application of Ultraconserved Elements ([UCEs](http://ultraconserved.org/)) is currently one of the most popular methods for phylogenomics using reduced representation genomic datasets. UCEs are highly conserved across distantly related taxa and have variable flanking regions. These characteristics make UCEs useful genetic markers for both deep and shallow evolutionary timescales, and they have successfully been used to resolve challenging phylogenetic relationships among many taxa (eg. birds, turtles, fishes). 

Here, we sequenced ~2,386 UCEs loci and 108 loci well known and used in previous phylogenetic studies for birds, for 105 individuals of 53/75 species currently recognized for the genus *Turdus* ([Nylander et al., 2008](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/2/257.full.pdf+html), [Collar et al., 2016 - HB](http://www.hbw.com/)) sampled across its entire distribution (see Fig.2 Americas, Eurasia and African Continents), and 7 individuals as outgroup (*Oenanthae oenanthae*, *Catharus gracilirostris*, *Zoothera dumasi/joiceyi*, *Zoothera dauma*, *Cochoa viridis*, *Ridgwayi pinicola*, *Zoothera citrina albogularis*), to reconstructe a robust phylogeny of the genus using a genomic data set.
